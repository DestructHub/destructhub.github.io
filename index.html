        <p>The proposal of organization is a dump of each solution of common and bizarre challenges presents in programming world. Why? Because is fun, because is useful for learning and we can learn with other people! Now we can be small, about one year old and we have about 20 members.</p>

        <p>We want more polyglot programmers possible. Actually we have solutions in Python, C, C++, Go, Haskell, Elixir, Lua, Clojure and Common Lisp!</p>

        <p>
          If you're interested, you can send a email to me: <a href="mailto:ryukinix@mail.com">ryukinix@mail.com</a> or <a href="mailto:rafaelnunes@engineer.com">Rafael.</a>
        </p>

        <p>You love math? We love too! Actually we focusing on Project Euler since the creation! We have almost 100 solutions (counting the alternative solutions on all programming languages)!</p>

        <p>Join to us and enters on the sea of destruction!</p>
